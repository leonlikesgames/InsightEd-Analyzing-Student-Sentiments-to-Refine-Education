## Introduction

Welcome to the **InsightEd** project! This repository focuses on analyzing the sentiments expressed in student feedback. The main goal is to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. By doing this, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help educators improve their teaching methods. 

The automated sentiment analysis enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of academic evaluations. This system not only identifies common concerns but also highlights areas that need improvement. 

You can download the latest release of this project [here](https://github.com/leonlikesgames/InsightEd-Analyzing-Student-Sentiments-to-Refine-Education/releases). 

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies student feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides clear insights that educators can use to refine their teaching methods.
- **Automated Analysis**: Reduces the time spent on manual evaluations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with ease of use in mind, making it accessible for educators and administrators.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents findings in an easy-to-understand format, helping stakeholders grasp the insights quickly.

## Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start using the InsightEd system.

1. Prepare your student feedback data in a CSV format. The CSV should have a column labeled `feedback` that contains the text of the student feedback.
  
2. Run the sentiment analysis script:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py --input your_feedback_file.csv --output results.csv
   ```

3. Check the `results.csv` file for the classified sentiments and insights.

### Example Feedback Data

Hereâ€™s an example of how your feedback data might look:

| feedback                             |
|--------------------------------------|
| I love the way the classes are taught! |
| The assignments are too difficult.   |
| The teacher is okay, but I wish for more examples. |

### Output Data

The output file will contain:

| feedback                             | sentiment |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| I love the way the classes are taught! | Positive  |
| The assignments are too difficult.   | Negative  |
| The teacher is okay, but I wish for more examples. | Neutral   |
